# 📈 Custom Linear Regression from Scratch

This project is a simple implementation of **Linear Regression** using only **Python and NumPy**, without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.  
It’s designed to demonstrate how linear regression works under the hood — from computing gradients to updating weights using gradient descent.

## 🔍 What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning.  
It models the relationship between a dependent variable `y` and one or more independent variables `x` by fitting a linear equation.
